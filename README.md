The Advanced Recipe Recommender System is an intelligent desktop application designed
to help users discover new recipes based on their preferences, available ingredients, and dietary
choices. Built using Python (Tkinter GUI) and powered by Natural Language Processing (NLP)
techniques like TF-IDF and cosine similarity, this system provides personalized and accurate
recipe recommendations.
The application enhances user experience by integrating multiple features such as cuisine
detection, favourites management, nutrition visualization, feedback collection, and a friendly
chat assistant that guides users interactively. Users can search for recipes by name or
ingredients, view nutrition charts, save favourite recipes, and receive smart suggestions through
an engaging interface.
This project combines machine learning concepts, data analysis, and user interface design to
create a practical solution for everyday cooking challenges, making it easier to explore diverse
cuisines and maintain healthy food habits.
In today’s fast-paced digital era, people increasingly rely on technology to assist with daily
decision-making — from shopping and entertainment to health and cooking. The Advanced
Recipe Recommender System is an intelligent application designed to simplify the process of
finding and selecting recipes according to users’ preferences, available ingredients, and dietary
needs. It leverages machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to
provide accurate, efficient, and personalized recipe recommendations.
